# blackfloorShader
Emulate raised black floors

There are two shaders.  Either can be run alone, but if you run blackfloor1 pre-resize and blackfloor2 post-resize you can toggle both on/off to compare two different raised black floors.

These are designed for HDR output.  If you are using madVR, use HDR passthrough.

You can edit peak nits and contrast ratio.

Place the shaders in %AppData%\MPC-BE\Shaders
Toggle pre-resize using Ctrl+P, and post-resize using Ctrl+Alt+P
